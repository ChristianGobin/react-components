## Image Search App with Search Bar Component.
Description: The App is an image searching browser using the Unsplash API. The user enters some search term and it is processed through an event handler. Axios is used to take this search term and send an AJAX request to the Unsplash API using this search term and finally the images are rendered on the page for the user.
