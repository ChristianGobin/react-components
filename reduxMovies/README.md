### Movie Select.
<h5> How it Works </h5>
<p> 
  Using React, Redux and the react-redux library, I created a Single Page Web Application that displays data concerning the movie titles a user has selected. Upon clicking the movie title, a brief summary of the selected movie will appear. This is done through utilizing redux as a state managment tool instead of class based react components. 
</p>
<p>
  In order to use this app you must use 'npx create-react-component reduxmovies' in your terminal. This creates the boiler plate for a react Application. Next you need to install the dependencies of react-redux and redux by using the command: 
  'npm install --save react-redux react'
  finally replace the src folder with a clone of my src folder and run 'npm build'.
